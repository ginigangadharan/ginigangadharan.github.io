Ansible Collection is a great way of getting content contributions from various Ansible Developers. Earlier there was a tagline for Ansible – “Batteries included”, but now the battery is a bit small I will say as default Ansible installation will still include the necessary libraries and modules needed for your automation kickstart but not the entire Ansible module and libraries. This is good in a way that Ansible developers don’t need to wait for a specific release cycle of Ansible to include their latest version of module or library; instead they can distribute their content and make available latest versions via Ansible Collections separately.
