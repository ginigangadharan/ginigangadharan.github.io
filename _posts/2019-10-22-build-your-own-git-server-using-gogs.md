When it comes to VCS (Version Control System), we will have confusion as we have many products in market with almost same capabilities. When we think about enterprise level usage, GitLab, GitHub, Subversion, Bitbucket etc. will come on top of the list and some are with enterprise level support too.

Installing our own git server with GUI is not a big deal as we have gitlab-ce (Learn more) which is free and another option is self-hosted bitbucket (but not free), or you can go for other premium VCS solutions. Fortunately, we have a simple opensource product called Gogs, which itself described as “A painless self-hosted Git service“. Yes, you can setup your own gitlab/github like git server with Gogs. You have different choices for installation from source, from packages, from binaries or just run it inside a docker container.
