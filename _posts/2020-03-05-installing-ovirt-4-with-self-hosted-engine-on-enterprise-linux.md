oVirt is one of the best free and open-source virtualization solution with enterprise level features. Installing oVirt cluster is simple and straight forward and you can refer the installation guide to achieve the same.

Basically you will setup oVirt Engine (Controller) and add oVirt Nodes to the cluster. But we donâ€™t need a dedicated physical server for oVirt Engine but you can host it as a VM in oVirt itself via Self-Hosted Engine method. See the demo below for details.
