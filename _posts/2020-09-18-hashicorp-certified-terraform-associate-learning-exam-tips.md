I started using Terraform somewhere in 2018, but very limited usage as I thought it is just another tool for provisioning infrastructure and other services – or a variant of Vagrant; and I never expected that Terraform will grow in such way that, most of the organizations prefer to use it, especially when they have multi-cloud architecture.

So, I have decided to explore more by converting our Ansible and Vagrant based projects to Terraform configurations; yes still using Ansible inside as provisioner. And later I decided to sit for HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate exam, which is the official Certification program conducting by HashiCorp. So, this is another review or preparation kind of stuff for Terraform Certification Exam as I received few queries on the same and thought to add a note here.
