Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is one of the best kubernetes platform for enterprises. As we know kubernetes and OpenShift are multi-component stack and not easy to learn without a proper curriculum. Yes, I agree that the documentation is superb but that is for reference and not useful if you are a beginner.

Fortunately Red Hat is offering some of the basic courses free of charge and you can enroll with a valid email ID. Honestly, theses are basic courses but more than enough for you to understand the platform.
