When we talk about virtualization, VMWare is one of the best choice and most popular in town. You can download VMware vSphere Hypervisor 6.7 for FREE and install on bare metal servers or workstations; but this will be single node cluster. You need VMWare vCenter for a full vSphere cluster experience and this is a licensed software. Fortunately, VMWare is offering free trial for this product and you can download the trial software from their portal.

Disclaimer : This demo is for explaining the steps to cover VMWare vCenter installation in a lab or test environment. You must consider recommended prerequisites and configurations for production level clusters.
