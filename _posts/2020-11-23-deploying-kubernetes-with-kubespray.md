You have multiple ways to deploy a production ready Kubernetes cluster and Kuberspray is another method in which we will use Ansible for configuring the nodes and deploying a kubernetes cluster in a pre-provisioned infrastructure. You can automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform or even using Ansible but we are not covering that in this article.
