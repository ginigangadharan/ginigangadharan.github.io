As we know, Ansible Tower is a multi-component system including Ansible, Tower API, RabbitMQ, Database (managed or external) etc. And will be more complicated when you install Ansible Tower Cluster (multi-node or multi-data center clusters).

So, what if you need to stop Ansible Tower gracefully, for some reason (patching or some reason) and start components again ?
